VanillaItems is an addon to CustomItemAPI that converts all vanilla items into custom items, allowing you to have a consistant theme and lets you modify item properties.

**WARNING: This plugin is not compatible with custom items from plugins not using CustomItemAPI! They will get overwritten**

**This plugin is in early development, since CustomItemAPI has not been officially released. Breaking changes are to be expected.**

## Requirements
* Java 17 or newer
* Server Software with Paper API.
* CustomItemAPI
* Minecraft 1.19 or later

## Support
This plugin is still in early development. Due to this, we do not yet have any proper avenues of support set up. In the meantime, create an issue and I will respond as soon as possible.
